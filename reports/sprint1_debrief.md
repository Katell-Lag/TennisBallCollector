### Retour d'expérience du PO

We spent a lot of time strategizing together, and sometimes we had a little trouble understanding each other.
I was surprised at how much time it took to set up the SCRUM method, and I didn't have time to code much.
However, it was a very good experience because the team gets along very well.


### Conseils pour le prochain PO

I think we need to use the board more to express your ideas because it is sometimes difficult to get into the head of others.
I think we should improve the system of assigning tasks, and make it clear to everyone. 


## Nouvelles mesures

- set up a common naming system
- better distribution of tasks
