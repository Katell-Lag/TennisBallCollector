#+TITLE: Goals for 25/01/2022

PO: Master Yohann Gourret

* Expected functionalities
- to have a working robot
  - fully modeled
  - working in the simulation

- initial version of the control algorithm
  - for searching 01 ball
  - usage of potential fields method for avoiding obstacles

- initial estimation from the camera
  - balls and robot position
  - robot orientation

* Tasks for the day
1. get the robot to spawn correctly in gazebo
2. model clamp for catching the balls
3. determine walls and obstacles positions
4. track balls for determining position
5. track robot orientation from distinguished elements on top
6. determine algorithm for going to the balls
7. implement initial control node communications

* Technical challenges
1. understand the new elements on how to use gazebo
2. how to create an effective clamp for the ball
3. guarantee working control algorithm
