#+TITLE: Debriefing for 25/02/2022

PO: Master Yohann Gourret

* Review

Percentage of accomplished tasks: 80%

** What worked
- The robot spawns correctly in the world and has a functional clamp, which succeeds in cleaning the balls when manually controlled.
- The obstacle positions was found in the gazebo simulation and will be used for the control algorithm.
- More communication nodes were established between the camera post-processing, the waypoint generation and the control. The multiarray structure was established correctly for sending the position of the balls.

** What did not work
- There still isn't the tracking of the balls or of the robot.
- The orientation of the robot is not computed.
- The path planning algorithm has not yet been tested to work.

** PO experience


** Advice for the next PO


* New decisions
We adapted the communication to use multiarrays. The division of nodes is clearer.
